| Algorithm<br />       | Accuracyâ€¨ <br />(correctly classified instances) | Time to build model<br /> | Readability<br />(order by easiest to hardest)               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NaiveBayes            | 635<br />92.9722 %                               | 0.01 s                    | 2. The outputs are in table forms, so it is easy to read     |
| Multilayer Perceptron | 638<br />93.4114 %                               | 22.27 s                   | 4. Hardest to read sinces there are too many outputs, it will take a long time to read these outputs |
| JRip                  | 630<br />92.2401 %                               | 0.15 s                    | 3. The outputs are crowded and it will need to use logic to read the outputs |
| J48                   | 625<br />91.5081 %                               | 0.04 s                    | 1. Easiest to read since the relationship is clear and we can visualize a tree diagram |
